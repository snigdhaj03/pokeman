1. Overview of this project :
   
In the world of pokemon, where the user should be able to search for different pokemons, you have to create an application to search them with the following functionalities:

The Pokemon application should have the list of pokemon details which will be provided in the form of JSON data i.e., it should have name, image, CP, attack, defense type etc.
It should have a search bar so that user can search the pokemon based on the name of pokemon.
Since we have many pokemon, apply pagination, so that user can only see 10 pokemon at a time.
